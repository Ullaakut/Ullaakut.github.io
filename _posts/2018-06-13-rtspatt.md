title: "How to run an RTSP Media Server"
published: true

This story is targeted to a really niche audience, but I think it addresses a problem that doesn’t currently have any satisfying answer, as far as I could see when I was asking this question myself.

RTSP stands for Real Time Streaming Protocol, it’s a protocol that is widely used by video surveillance cameras, but also for streaming media on the internet, doing video calls, and other applications.

I recall originally using the excellent [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) for serving video over RTSP, and one day I needed it to have authentication, which VLC didn’t seem to handle. I entered the VLC IRC server, and asked them if I could help implementing it. They answered something along the lines of _“Only mad people use this anyway, but sure go ahead, it’s in this file.”_ and pointed me to a 5 000 lines, 10 year old C file.

Another thing to note is that the command that I used to run my media server was very complicated, check it out:

I did some more research to try and find a way to have an RTSP server with authentication, and there were a few candidates:

* `live555` was the most obvious one, but it had a huge problem: it is very badly documented. Their FAQ literally says:
The best way to understand how to use the libraries is to study the example programs in the “testProgs” directory, study the library code itself, and ask questions on the “[live-devel](http://lists.live555.com/mailman/listinfo/live-devel/)” mailing list.
Also, it wasn’t simple to use at all.
* `ffserver` seemed perfect, was made by the same people as the universally acclaimed `ffmpeg` but it was deprecated and development stopped. I tried using the latest version but ran into a few problems, so I decided to keep looking.
* `gst-rtsp-server` is a reliable solution, used by many professional software, but unfortunately it’s not easy to use because it’s a library and requires you to write C/C++ code to build your own server.

## Which is why I made my own Media Server

I wanted to make something completely cross-platform, easy to use, that has a lot of features and that is performant. Here is the result: [RTSPAllTheThings](https://github.com/Ullaakut/RTSPAllTheThings).

It’s far from perfect, but it does what it’s been designed for. It’s a simple Media Server that was written using the `gst-rtsp-server` library and that can be used with a Docker image.

It handles authentication (basic and digest), can stream input files, preset video patterns (a ball that moves, white noise, etc.), the video feed from a device, or even relay another RTSP stream. You can also add a time overlay, change the frame rate of the video or change the stream’s resolution.

Now to get the same video stream as I did with the very long command using VLC above, I just need to run `docker run --rm -p 8554:8554 ullaakut/rtspatt`.

A more complex command, that would handle authentication, serve a video file and set a custom address and port would be `docker run --rm -e INPUT="/tmp/video.avi" -e RTSP_ADDRESS=172.100.100.12 -e RTSP_PORT=18554 -v "/path/to/your/video:/tmp/video.avi" -p 18554:18554 ullaakut/rtspatt`

## Conclusion

The problem is still there though, my software doesn’t have enough features at the moment to be a universal solution, and there doesn’t seem to be any other solution that are easy to use and work out of the box. Right now, if you have a specific need that isn’t covered by RTSPATT and that you don’t have the time/knowledge to use gst-rtsp-server or live555, let me know by [creating an issue on RTSPATT](https://github.com/Ullaakut/RTSPAllTheThings/issues/new), and maybe I’ll be able to help you out.

If you know of a better solution, please leave a comment on this article to tell me about it, and I’ll probably rewrite this article with it in mind. Also, if you’d like to help me build a solution to this problem, you are more than welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/Ullaakut/RTSPAllTheThings).
